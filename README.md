I've initiated the landing page project, focusing on HTML and CSS. I'm structuring index.html with the standard HTML5 elements, and ensuring I link to the style.css file for styling. The goal is a responsive design that is both elegant and efficient.
The hero section is planned with a heading, paragraph, and CTA button. I'm finalizing the footer with social link placeholders, ready for CSS styling. I'll use Inter font and implement flexbox for a simple layout.
I've sketched out the HTML structure in index.html, including the standard tags, meta viewport, and a link to the style.css. I've added a header with navigation, a hero section with a heading, paragraph, and CTA button, and a footer with social links. Now, I'm defining the CSS in style.css, detailing body styling, the Inter font, and a flexbox layout.
